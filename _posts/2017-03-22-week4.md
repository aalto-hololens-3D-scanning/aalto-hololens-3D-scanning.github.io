title: Week 4 â€“ Scan with HoloLens
---

## Reading the Holoscanner blog.
### How do you control scanning with HoloLens?
[Holoscanner] used `RemoteMeshManager` and `RemoteMeshSource` in **[HoloToolkit](https://github.com/YoungxHelsinki/HoloToolkit)** for crowd-scanning.

### Floor/Ceiling Plane Finding
_copied from the blog_

We will be generating targets at random locations on the floor plane. In order to do this, we must first know where the floor and ceiling planes are. We estimate the locaiton of these planes as follows:

- Smooth the Y-coordinates of all the vertices currently known using a Gaussian kernel. This is to reduce noise.
- We compute a histogram of a Y-coordinate locations.
- We locate the bottom-most and upper-most local extrema in terms of the frequency of Y-coordinates.


## `RemoteMaipping` in HoloToolkit

### [Microsoft documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloToolkit-Unity/blob/master/Assets/HoloToolkit/SpatialMapping/README.md)
**RemoteMapping.unity**

The RemoteMapping scene uses the SpatialMapping and RemoteMapping prefabs to send spatial mapping data between the HoloLens and the app running in the Unity editor. To run this test, you must first open port 11000 on your firewall and then set the IPv4 address of your PC in the 'RemoteMeshTarget' and 'RemoteMeshSource' components. You can then build and deploy to the HoloLens. Once you see the wireframe mesh appear in your HoloLens, press the 'play' button in Unity to run the app in Editor. Ensure that the 'Game view' has focus, and then press the 'N' key (RemoteMappingKey) to switch to using the network as the spatial mapping source in the Editor. Once you are confident that you have a good mesh, say the 'Send Meshes' (SendMeshesKeyword) to send the meshes from the HoloLens to the Unity Editor. Press the 'S' key (SaveFileKey) to save the mesh to your PC. Press the 'play' button to stop the app from running in the Unity editor. Now, press 'play' one more time to restart the app. This time, press the 'L' key (LoadFileKey) to load the mesh that you previously saved into the Editor.

### Lesson learned
Set both source and target IP to **PC** not HoloLens!

### To do
App reloads memorized recordings. Start from fresh. Run garbage collection after sending to avoid crash.
